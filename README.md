# MERN stack restaurant application

- This is a Full stack(MERN) restaurant app whose data(menu) is stored in MongoDB which is being shown on frontend.
- The user can choose anything from the menu, add to cart & see the total amount.
- Frontend tech: React JS
- Backend tech: Node JS

- To run this app, just unzip this zip & install node_modules on your system. Install MongoDB Compass & run ```node Mongo1.js``` from Terminal or CMD, so as to run the database.
- Then, open another window of CMD & run: ```npm start``` which will start your app on the browser.

- Let's try out the deployed version: https://mernstackrestaurant-app.netlify.app/
- Note: You may not be able to view data on the deployed version as well becuase that is saved in MongoDB & as the MongoDB's data is not connected to the netlify app, it will not show the data.
- Therefore, I am attaching a video of my deployed version:
